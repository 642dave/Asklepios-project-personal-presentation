        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 2025</p>
        
        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Welcome to the ASKLEPIOS demo medical system. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle and protect 
            any information used within this application. Please note that this is a **demonstration system** and 
            is **not intended for real medical use**.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>
            Since ASKLEPIOS is a demo application, **no real user data is collected, stored, or processed**.
            Any information entered into the system is entirely fictional and used solely for testing and 
            demonstration purposes.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Use of Data</h3>
        <p>
            The data entered into ASKLEPIOS is only used to showcase the systemâ€™s functionality. This means:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>All entered data is temporary and non-persistent.</li>
            <li>There is no real user authentication or identity verification.</li>
            <li>No actual medical records are stored or processed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Data Security</h3>
        <p>
            While basic security measures are implemented to protect the application, ASKLEPIOS is **not a production system** 
            and should not be used for handling sensitive or real-world medical data.
        </p>
        <p>Security measures include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Basic encryption of stored demo data.</li>
            <li>Limited access control within the demo environment.</li>
            <li>No external data sharing or third-party integrations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Limitations of This System</h3>
        <p>
            This system is designed **only for demonstration purposes**. As such, it **should not be relied upon for any real medical decision-making**. 
            By using this system, you acknowledge that it is strictly for educational and presentation use.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Changes to This Policy</h3>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any modifications will be reflected on this page. 
            Since this is a demo application, updates will not affect any real-world data, as none is stored.
        </p>
